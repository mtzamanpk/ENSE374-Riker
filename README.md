## Project Idea

#### Meme Generator, which allows you to create your own meme to incorporate into your presentations and daily lives.

## Project Background/Business Opportunity 

#### Creating a meme generator, which saves older memes, and shows it on the main home page. Creating memes can be difficult, but with this product, we are making it extremely easy to do. Making it as user friendly as possible, to ease the users process of navigating through the website. Everyone loves to laugh,  and giving people a reason to smile is a good business opportunity to increase the chances of getting a potentially better offer from your business partner. Overall makes it easier for everything to make people laugh.
